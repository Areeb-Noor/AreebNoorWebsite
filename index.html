            Currently a third year student in Business Technology Management at
            Toronto Metropolitan University (formerly known as Ryerson
            University), actively seeking co-op/internship opportunities for
            Summer 2023.

            Over the past couple of years I have really developed a new passion
            for technology. Seeing as how the future will be heavily technology
            based I have thrown myself in various different environments to
            develop and expand my knowledge and skills with technology. Although
            I have a passion for technology, I feel a managerial or
            administrative role would best suit my personality and experience.
            And so to really leverage both the business and tech sides of my
            degree and education, I am hoping to enter the field of product or
            project management.

            I am an avid comic reader and I also have lots of love for their
            live-action adaptations. I really enjoy watching anime as seeing all
            sorts of different animations come to life is something I've always
            found amazing. But by far my favourite hobby is food. I absolutely
            love adventuring out to try new cuisines and food styles.
